- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- All 3 `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers (FR-001 ingestion paths, FR-005
  action autonomy, FR-006 sourcing-option provenance) were resolved with
  the user on 2026-08-14: manual/CSV entry for MVP (API-first for future
  integrations); recommend-by-default with opt-in per-rule auto-trigger;
  SME's own backups first, platform-curated directory as fallback. Spec
  updated accordingly. Checklist fully passes — ready for `/sp.plan`.
